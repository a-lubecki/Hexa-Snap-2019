# Hexa-Snap-2019

Hexa Snap is my first released mobile game on Android and iOS. 
It's a 2D arcade game with an old grey style like Tetris on GameBoy.

There are 2 modes:
- Arcade: try to reach the level 20 (level 100 for hardcode mode)
- Time Attack: try to reach 5 min

Players can advance in both modes with a bonuses system.
They can unlock bonuses in a dedicated "Upgrades" menu by spending Hexacoins (the money of the game).
When they are unlocked, bonuses appear as new blocks in game and can be used by clicking on it.

But bonuses in blue are linked to maluses in red.
Players can then spend more hexacoins to disable unlocked maluses.

### Narration

I created an animated character who speak through all game and add some jokes with various faces.
It also explains the gameplay during the onboarding.
